3.Read solutions of similar competitions.

4.Read papers to make sure I donâ€™t miss any progress in the field.

5.Analyze the data and build a stable CV.

6.Data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training.

7.Result analysis such as prediction distribution, error analysis, hard examples.

8.Elaborate models or design a new model based on the analysis.

9.Based on data analysis and result analysis, design models to add diversities or solve hard samples.

10.Ensemble.

11.Return to a former step if necessary.
